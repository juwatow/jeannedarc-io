        "I've grown from an individual contributor with a strong technical foundation to a leader focused on driving business impact. My experience across various roles in software development, from front-end to back-end, mobile, platform engineering, and Scrum Master, has equipped me with a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle. This has enabled me to empathize with diverse teams and collaborate effectively. As a leader, I've learned to guide teams toward delivering meaningful results while fostering their growth and development. Over the past three years, I've developed a passion for Developer Experience (DX). I've measured DX improvements through metrics like developer satisfaction surveys, time-to-market for new features, and the frequency of production incidents. To iterate on DX, I've implemented frameworks like OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) to align team goals with broader business objectives and Agile methodologies to foster collaboration and continuous improvement. By prioritizing DX, I've been able to increase team productivity, reduce time-to-market, and improve overall software quality.",

        ` My careeer journey can be summarized into 3 phases:`,
        ` Phase I | 2007-2017: as Camille Fournier describes it very well in her article “The Senior Shift”, this phase was about me growing from someone who needed a lot of oversight to an independent engineer. I focused on developing the best practices and pushing high-quality code. That led me to own bigger and more complex projects and show that I was capable, independent, and trustworthy (some examples: added Solr to support the Full Text Search and Redis as our caching system to improve the performance)`,
        ` Phase II | 2017-2022: This phase was about increasing the scope of ownership, delivery, and impact. Started by leading the first product team where the EPD triad partnership operated in the way described by Marty Cagan (PM: viable & valuable, Design: Usable, Engineering: Feasible), experimenting with new ways of delivering a feature which resulted in releasing ahead of time and the team became an inspiration to other teams in the company. This phase was marked by developing leadership skills, guiding people through coaching, mentoring and sponsorship, and implementing strategies to cope with industry challenges like hiring, compensation, onboarding, retaining and attrition.`,
        ` Phase III | 2022-Now: From my journey so far I have come to realize that any SaaS company will go through multiple transitions, for example, a successful feature launch or partnership that brings thousands or millions of new users and requires the company to scale the team and the application. While these transitions are inevitable, I am challenging myself to make them as smooth as possible for any organization and the people behind it by leveraging data to guide them in putting quickly in place adequate processes, habits/rituals and mindset for each transition.`
