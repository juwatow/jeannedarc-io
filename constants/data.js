        "I'm an engineering leader with a proven track record of success, having transitioned from a strong technical foundation as an individual contributor to a leader focused on driving impactful business results. <br />" +
        "My experience as an engineering manager with a PM mindset has equipped me with a deep understanding of the entire software development lifecycle. This unique perspective allows me to empathize with diverse teams across the development spectrum, fostering effective collaboration. I excel at guiding teams to deliver meaningful solutions while nurturing their growth and development. <br />" + 
        "Over the past few years, I've developed a passion for the developer experience (DX) and the transformative power of platform engineering. I'm particularly interested in helping scale-up companies  leverage these practices to elevate their engineering capabilities and align them with their business goals.",

        ` My careeer journey can be summarized into 3 phases:`,
        ` Phase I | 2007-2017: as Camille Fournier describes it very well in her article “The Senior Shift”, this phase was about me growing from someone who needed a lot of oversight to an independent engineer. I focused on developing the best practices and pushing high-quality code. That led me to own bigger and more complex projects and show that I was capable, independent, and trustworthy (some examples: added Solr to support the Full Text Search and Redis as our caching system to improve the performance)`,
        ` Phase II | 2017-2022: This phase was about increasing the scope of ownership, delivery, and impact. Started by leading the first product team where the EPD triad partnership operated in the way described by Marty Cagan (PM: viable & valuable, Design: Usable, Engineering: Feasible), experimenting with new ways of delivering a feature which resulted in releasing ahead of time and the team became an inspiration to other teams in the company. This phase was marked by developing leadership skills, guiding people through coaching, mentoring and sponsorship, and implementing strategies to cope with industry challenges like hiring, compensation, onboarding, retaining and attrition.`,
        ` Phase III | 2022-Now: From my journey so far I have come to realize that any SaaS company will go through multiple transitions, for example, a successful feature launch or partnership that brings thousands or millions of new users and requires the company to scale the team and the application. While these transitions are inevitable, I am challenging myself to make them as smooth as possible for any organization and the people behind it by leveraging data to guide them in putting quickly in place adequate processes, habits/rituals and mindset for each transition.`
