# SUMMARY

A lifelong learner, passionate about software product development and how a team/organization building softwares can achieve "Great Results & Great Human Satisfaction". I strive to empower people around me to reach their highest potential by guiding product/platform teams to become values-driven, self-organizing and high-performant as well as partnering with the EPD triad and other stakeholders to create an environment where we continuously improve in order to achieve the desired business outcomes.

# CAREER

## May 2021 - Oct 2022: Engineering Manager, Xello

Xello is transforming the way Students in USA, Canada and UK become Future Ready by providing:

1. Tools students use for self-discovery, exploration of post-secondary schools/colleges and career options and, for creation of impactful plans.

### Some highlights of my contribution to this mission:

- Leading 2 product teams and 1 platform team
- Mentoring, Coaching and Sponsoring 17 engineers of all experience levels
- Advocating for continuously finding new ways for the engineering team to effectively accomplish the mission by introducing various process improvements & strategies for hiring, onboarding, delivering a high quality product, individual growth and retaining people who are aligned with the company's values & mission
  - Created a structured hiring process and trained our engineering team on how to use it
  - Introduced the [Radical Candor framework](https://www.radicalcandor.com) to encourage guidance and feedback
  - Introduced [SPACE: A Framework to measure productivity](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124) and DORA Metrics to ensure product teams make data-driven decisions
  - Introduced some practices to encourage a writing culture (ADRs, RFCs, Design Docs, Technical Documentation,...)
  - Introduced some practices to improve our remote-first environment (advocated for Async communication, meeting efficiency, ...)
- Technical contribution: Code Reviews, Write/Review Design Doc, Fix Bugs, Write Documentation, Automate tasks
- Led an initiative to build Taco, Xello’s first Design System, to increase the productivity of our product teams: hired 2 interns to team up with 2 UI engineers and our lead designer. Tools: [Lit](https://lit.dev/) (web components - html/css/javascript), Zeroheight, Figma, Miro, Airtable
- Led an initiative to foster greater connectedness in a remote-first work setting: created a process to effectively run a one-hour weekly open-space session for our triad (product, user experience and engineering) to reflect on software development practices, share learned lessons from various projects and pitch solutions for some of our engineering challenges, allow engineers to level-up their communication skills. Tools/Skills: Advanced Meeting Facilitation Skills, Zoom, Trello, Google Workspace

## Jan 2021 - May 2021: Scrum Master - Cloud Platform, CaseWare International

The Cloud Platform team consisted of four small and self-organizing squads empowered to push the boundaries by trying various agile practices and using the most cutting-edge technologies, and obsessed by collaboratively providing a great cloud platform that enables internal and external developers to build a wide range of applications to automate tasks for accounting firms.
My contribution was mainly around helping the team in their journey of continuously reflecting and experimenting with ways of getting even better than what they were before.

### Some of my responsibilities included:

- Guide the squads on how to fully embrace empiricism by helping them making every scrum ritual (sprint planning, daily planning, sprint review and retrospective) an opportunity to inspect and most importantly to adapt.
- Remove impediments or guide the team to remove impediments by helping in escalating to the right personnel to assist and follow up until the impediment is removed.
- Coach, mentor the team on agile & software engineering practices like user story mapping, estimation, prioritization, swarming via pair/mob programming, different types of feedback loops (code review, automation in CI/CD pipeline, ...)
- Design, capture, help the team have a good visibility of their work and leverage different metrics as powerful tools for delivering products (e.g. flow efficiency, work item age, sprint burndown charts, WIP, issue cycle time, epic cycle time, mean time to resolve, customer satisfaction, OKRs, ...)
- Advise on ways to optimize a remote-first culture (how to achieve the right balance for synchronous and asynchronous communication?, how to stay connected while avoiding zoom fatigue?, use of tools like Slack HeyTaco for fun peer recognition, ...)

## Dec 2019 - Jan 2021: Scrum Master - Cloud Engagements, CaseWare International

Working with the Smart Engagement group (5 teams) to continuously uncover better ways of creating technology solutions to innovate the accounting, auditing and tax professions.

### Some of my responsibilities included:

- Assisting the group with our release cycle of 10 weeks: from the readiness (backlog refinements, prioritization of features & technical improvements, design walkthroughs, technical discussions and define a clear goal in Release Planning session - SAFe PI Planning), through the development & regression phase (help identify and escalate any impediment to achieve our goals, assist in incorporating the feedback loop) until the
  product increment is released.
- Ensuring the three pillars of empiricism are constantly lived by teams: assist with tools and artifacts to maintain transparency (different jira boards - scrum & kanban -, dashboards, Structure plugin for Jira, Confluence, Slack, Miro), facilitate sessions to inspect and adapt (daily scrum, review & demo, retrospective).
- Putting in place tools that aggregate different insights to help the teams/group making decisions based on data and become more productive (cycle time, flow efficiency, WIP, ...).
- Promoting continuous learning and continuous improvements by encouraging conversations at different levels of the company, by facilitating a discussion forum focusing on our journey of achieving agility, by researching and suggesting learning platforms or resources based on the specific challenges faced by the group, skills people want to improve or goals they want to achieve (introduced practices like user stories mapping, mob pair/mob programming).
- Facilitating agile-related onboarding sessions and coach new team members (permanent and co-ops: on average, 15 co-ops join us every year) and making sure the
  dynamic in the teams doesn't become an impediment to achieve their goals.
